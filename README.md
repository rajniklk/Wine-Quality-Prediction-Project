## About wine
* Wine is a beverage made from fermented grape and other fruit juices with lower amount of alcohol content. 
* Quality of wine is graded based on the taste of wine and vintage. This process is time taking, costly and not efficient. 
* A wine itself includes different parameters like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulphur dioxide, total sulphur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol and quality. 
## Problem Statement
* In industries, understanding the demands of wine safety testing can be a complex task for the laboratory with numerous analytes and residues to monitor.
* But, our applicationâ€™s prediction, provide ideal solutions for the analysis of wine, which will make this whole process efficient and cheaper with less human interaction
* Wine Quality Prediction with PCA & LDA Algorithms
